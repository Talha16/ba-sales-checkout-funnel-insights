NovaCart is an online retailer aiming to improve conversion rates across its e-commerce checkout funnel. While traffic to the site is healthy, a significant number of users drop off before completing a purchase.

## Problem Statement

## Business Objective
The objective of this analysis is to:
- Understand user behavior across the checkout funnel
- Identify key drop-off points
- Define metrics that indicate checkout performance
- Provide insights that support future optimization decisions

## Checkout Funnel Stages
The checkout funnel is defined as:
1. Product Viewed
2. Add to Cart
3. Proceed to Checkout
4. Enter Shipping Information
5. Enter Payment Information
6. Order Confirmation

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
